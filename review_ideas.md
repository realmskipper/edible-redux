# Review Ideas

## 1. Cached Human-Written Reviews

Option to cache a user-generated or human-written review instead of (or alongside) the AI blurb.

- Allow editors/admins to write and save a curated review
- Falls back to AI-generated blurb if no human review exists
- Human reviews could be marked with a badge ("Editor's Pick" or similar)

## 2. Pinned Reviews

Feature a "pinned" review at the top of a restaurant's page.

- Could be staff-curated or algorithmically selected
- Highlights the most useful/insightful review
- Gives visibility to quality contributors

---

## 3. Community-Voted Reviews

Let users vote on reviews to surface the best ones.

- Upvote/downvote or "helpful" button
- Top-voted review gets pinned or featured
- Encourages quality contributions from users
- Could tie into gamification (badges, leaderboard)

## 4. Premium Photo Uploads

Premium customers can upload additional photos to restaurant pages.

- Adds value to premium tier
- Builds a richer photo library over time
- Could require moderation/approval before going live
- Attribution shown for the uploader

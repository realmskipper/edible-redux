# Photo Collection Ideas

## Outreach for High-Quality Photos

Reach out directly to photographers and food bloggers to license or use their restaurant photos.

### Approach
- Find high-quality photos on Instagram, Yelp, or food blogs
- Email the photographer directly
- Offer attribution in the app (e.g., "Photo by @username")
- Consider a small credit or feature in exchange for usage rights

### Benefits
- Curated, high-quality imagery
- Builds community relationships
- Avoids generic stock photos
- Attribution gives photographers exposure

### Email Template (Draft)
> Hi [Name],
>
> I came across your photo of [Restaurant] and loved it. I'm building a restaurant discovery app called Edible Dialect and would love to feature your photo with full attribution.
>
> Would you be open to letting us use it? Happy to link to your profile or website.
>
> Thanks!
